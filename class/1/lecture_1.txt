Cryptography: keeping things secret.

- What does it mean to keep information secret?

Alice -----------> Bob
	   ^
	   |
	  Eve (always watching and listening...)

What information does Eve have?
- Eve speaks same language as Alice and Bob (knows how to interpret plaintext and recognize it)
- Eve is listening to what Alice and Bob are saying (and they say a lot of things)*
- Eve is clever
- Eve knows how the information is being scrambbled (she knows the algorithm), but is missing the "key"

Key (my definition): Algorithm + key = complete knowlege e.g. nothing is secret.

-----------------------------------
Example: 

1
--
	Ciphertext: Qrz dv L zdv brxqj dqg hdvb xqghu wkh dssoh erxjkv <- time to think about this
	Plaintext:  Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
	
	Shift cipher (rotation cypher, ceaser cipher).  In this case shift by 3.
		
	Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
	Cipher:   DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC

	key: n \in [1,2,3,...,25]

2
--
	Ciphertext: zoo rtmlizmxv glylttzmh rmgl pmld
	Plaintext:  all ignorance toboggans into know

	Atbash cipher.
	Plain:	ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
	Cipher: ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA
	
	key: None (just an algorithm)

These are all examples of substitution ciphers.

A <-> J
B <-> F
... etc.

key: on an alphabet of N letters, key \in S_N (N! possabilities)
--------------------------------

Attacks: types of secret information.  Is it still secret when Eve has access to certain information?

Possible assumptions under which we can talk about security.
- cyphertext only
- plain, cipher pairs
- chosen cyphertext
- chosen plaintext

---------------------------------
Excersise:

1
--
	Under which assumptions are the above cryptosystems secret (Answer none (assuming there is a lot of available ciphertext, frequency analysis does the trick))

2
--
	In groups of 2-3 come up with a cipher.
	- ascii -> ascii
	- easy to implement

3
--
	Document your algorithm (sudo code, or code with LOTS OF COMMENTS!!!), and put it in the folder in public.



Before next class, run frequency analysis on your cipher of (really large open source document I will find.).  See if your cipher is secure under ciphertext only attack (result should be statistical noise).

* Perhaps a note about Unicity distance for people interested in the question of "how much?"
