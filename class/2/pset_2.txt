So first of all congratulations.  You now know what a Vegenere cipher is, so named after a French cryptographer.  It was actually the main cipher used by the South during the American civil war.  Unfortunately (for them) they only used five or so different keys, each of which was guessed by the North early on in the war, rendereing their encryption useless.

Exercises:

1)
	- Use your algorithm to encrypt les_mis.txt
	- Analyze the character frequency of the result
		* Does it look like noise? (that is, are all characters showing up with the same frequency, roughly?)
	- present your results as a critique (or a support) of your algorithm

2)
	Going back to the Vegenere cipher. The Vegenere cipher is more secure the longer and more random the key that is used. Indeed, if the key-length is as long as the messege, this is a very secure system.  However, that is unlikely to happen unless Bob has very little to say. However, frequency analysis can be successfully employed to attack this cipher, it is just more complicated.

	- Does applying the cipher twice make it inherently more secure? Explain.
	- If you applied the cipher enough (with the same key each time, of course) would you eventually get back to where you started?  The number of times this takes we will call the length of the cycle generated by the plaintext-key pair. 
	- Given a three letter plain-text 'cat', what is the longest cycle possible, and what key gives you this cycle?

	This is leading up to Groups.... but that's enough homework for one week.
